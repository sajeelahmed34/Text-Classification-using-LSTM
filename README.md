## Introduction: <a name="introduction"></a>
In this notebook, we will create a machine learning model that will classify "SMS" messages as "ham" or "spam". A ham message is a normal message that is not a spam or in other words it is a good message. A spam message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
